# Bookins system spec

### As a user I need to be able to:

- [ ] view available classes
- [ ] make a booking (including payment and sign up (ideally SSO with Google or Facebook))
- [ ] see my bookings
- [ ] cancel booking
- [ ] reschedule booking

### As an admin (coach, instructor) I need to be able to:

- [ ] CRUD classes/services (base item to book against)
- [ ] schedule classes (duration, slots, date, time, recurrence)
- [ ] manage bookings (create, reschedule, cancel, refund)
- [ ] create accounts
- [ ] view notifications
- [ ] view booking calendar
- [ ] add coach/instructor accounts

### Things to consider

- Should scheduled classes be automatically created?
- Create floating select (in development) to switch between user types (user, admin, coach)
